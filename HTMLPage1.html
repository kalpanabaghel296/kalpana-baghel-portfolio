    <h2>Philosophy:</h2>
    <p>Every man has his own heaven, but you gotta go through hell to be a man first.</p>
    <h2>My Courses:</h2>
    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>Over the course of this semester in Web Development I have learned many different things that are essential for developing a webpage. I learned about various languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and how to effectively use them to create a dynamic webpage. </p>

            DIV1
            <div id="div2">Look what I learned how to do. Isn't this cool!?</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Engineering Applications</h3>
    <p>Engineering Applications is the last course in the engineering pathway offered at Drew Charter School. The entire pathway is fairly rigorous, and in this particular course, the work is more independent since we spent two previous years learning and famiiliarizing ourselves with tools and techniques. This year, we are building a pinball machine, which is proving to be a very challenging task. Next year, I will have the opportunity to do an engineering internship to enhance my learning and get real world experience. Although it is very rigorous, I'm grateful for this experience and the opportunities it has and will bring me. </p>

    <h3>Pre-Calculus</h3>
    <p>I am currently taking Pre-Calculus as a Junior because I am on the accelerated math track. This means that next year I will be taking AP Calculus and hopefully won't have to take that course in college. This class is challenging but we have a really great teacher and I've always had the natural aptitude for math. Below is a picture of a recent project we did where we created rockets, launched them, and calculated how high they flew and at what angle. </p>

    <h3>AP Language and Composition</h3>
    <p>AP Language and Composition is a surprisingly easy class for me. I've never been the biggest fan of English class, but I've always been great at developing my ideas into essays.</p>

    <h3>Chamber Orchestra</h3>
    <p>I am a member of the Chamber Orchestra which is the highest orchestra level in our school. I've been playing the violin since 4th grade and have a renewed passion for music and instrumentation. I want to become really good at multiple instruments like piano and electric guitar. </p>

    <h3>Rec Games</h3>
    <p>Rec Games is a semester long class that I'm taking for the first time. It's essentially golf, and on some days we go to the golf course near our school. We will soon begin working on a PBL project where we design a minigolf course. </p>

    <h3>AP US History</h3>
    <p>AP US History is a fun but somewhat rigorous class. The teachers, Mr. Alford and Ms. Schaffer, are amazing teachers and work very well together. They make the class very fun and find great ways to keep us engaged. </p>

    <h3>Biology</h3>
    <p>Although I'm not the biggest fan of biology as a subject, we have a really good teacher who finds ways to keep us interested. We frequently do fun labs and recently we did a speed dating activity where we pretended to be different organelles and had to find an organelle that complemented our qualities. </p>

    <h2>Projects:</h2>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/The3rdJerry/pen/poKwLNY"><h3>Fan Page Project</h3></a>
    <p>Linked above is a project that my partner, Jerry Clay, and I did for Web Development. We were tasked to create a webpage on an athlete that goes to our school. We had to interview them on their hobbies and goals and use various web development skills to create an interesting, functional webpage. </p>
    <h2>Extracurricular Activities:</h2>
    <h3>Kappa League</h3>
    <p>Outside of school, I participated in the Alpharetta-Smyrna Alumni Chapter Guideright program (Kappa League). Kappa League is a mentoring program for young men where we learn valuable life lessons from members of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. We learn about wide range of topics from public speaking & essay writing, to how to build meaningful relationships. I'm not currently participating in Kappa League as I'm in another program called Beautillion, which is also under the foundation that manages Kappa League.</p>
    <h3>Diamond Beautillion</h3>
    <p>
        During the 2022-2023 school year, I've been participating in the Krimson Community Foundation's Diamond Beautillion Program. I'd say it's like a more mature version of Kappa League, with a heavy focus on college preparation and becoming young men that are equipped to handle societies challenges. We had a formal ceremony on April 2nd, where we delivered speeches and were presented with scholarship money that we had to raise individually. It's was a great experience and I learned a lot.
